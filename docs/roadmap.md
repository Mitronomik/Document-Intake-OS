# Roadmap

## M0 — Requirements locked

Result: requirements package, open-question status model, accepted decisions and repository documentation.

Gate: MVP scope is confirmed, real documents are excluded from the cloud/public development contour, the repository privacy boundary is accepted for non-sensitive code, terminal-specific blockers are either externally confirmed or staged to downstream gates under ADR-016, and no placeholder terminal values are invented.

GATE-M0 is completed and human accepted. PR-004 is completed and human accepted. GATE-S1 is completed and human accepted with ADR-018 accepted.

## M1 — Safe repository

PR-001–003.

Result: reproducible environment, CI, AGENTS, privacy guardrails and minimal UI.

M1 is accepted by the product owner after PR-003 was completed and merged through GitHub PR #4 at `ad5782045473d3ef5eb0a097cc8f6982bab821c7`.

## M2 — Local data core

PR-004–007.

Result: domain, SQLite, immutable storage and audit.

PR-004 — Core Domain is completed and human accepted. GATE-S1 is completed and human accepted. ADR-018 is accepted for Q-010. PR #9 merged PR-S001 as a research harness; PR-S001 is ACCEPTED WITH DOCUMENTED RESIDUAL RISK RISK-S001-W11. PR-005 is COMPLETED AND HUMAN ACCEPTED through GitHub PR #15. PR-006 is COMPLETED AND HUMAN ACCEPTED; PR-008 is AUTHORIZED, NOT STARTED; PR-009 and every later implementation task remains UNAUTHORIZED. M2 is completed and human accepted by PR-007 acceptance; PR-008 begins the next file-import foundation and is authorized but not started.

## M3 — Manual image workflow

PR-008–013.

Result: import, quality, crop/perspective, multiple docs, merge and JPEG ≤1.90 MiB.

Gate: типовые реальные фото локально готовятся без потери originals. Local evidence remains outside Git, Codex and CI.

## M4 — Manual end-to-end MVP

PR-014–018.

Result: batches, classification, cards, verification, application and snapshot.

Gate: приложение полезно без OCR.

## M5 — Three terminal exports

PR-019–023.

Result: Visitors, MGS, TSP and export package.

Gate: all terminal-specific external confirmations required by Q-001 through Q-005 and Q-015 exist, no placeholder terminal values are invented, approved template artifacts have passed technical privacy inspection and repository-policy enforcement if committed, all workbooks open without repair and real terminal upload is verified locally without committing real application data.

## M6 — OCR assistance

PR-024–029.

Result: local runtime, MRZ, passports/ID, vehicle documents, review UI and migration assistance.

Gate: field-level metrics are measured on local evidence outside Git, Codex and CI, and critical errors do not bypass the operator.

## M7 — Production hardening

PR-030–035.

Result: encryption, users, backup, installer, security tests and RC.

Gate: offline local acceptance and release decision.

## Future

- macOS build after Windows stabilization;
- дополнительные документы;
- несколько рабочих мест;
- новые терминалы;
- официальная интеграция only if an allowed API is separately approved.

## Не делать преждевременно

Cloud, web frontend, microservices, Kubernetes, event broker, vector DB, LLM, browser automation and plugin system.

## Current lifecycle after PR-005 merge and acceptance

GATE-M0: COMPLETED. GATE-M0 merge commit: `3dada63ea82163c7c4497e290b303d2cc781b085`. Human acceptance of GATE-M0 occurred after PR #5 merge. M0: ACCEPTED. M1: ACCEPTED. PR-004: COMPLETED AND HUMAN ACCEPTED. GATE-S1: COMPLETED AND HUMAN ACCEPTED. ADR-018: ACCEPTED. PR-S001: ACCEPTED WITH DOCUMENTED RESIDUAL RISK RISK-S001-W11; PR-S001-F1: COMPLETED; PR-S001-F2: COMPLETED; PR-S001-F3: COMPLETED; PR-S001-F4: COMPLETED AND MERGED THROUGH PR #13 at merge commit `985fae37c7645e8f65edbe4d1609100ee24a2097`.

PR-005: COMPLETED AND HUMAN ACCEPTED through GitHub PR #15 (`PR-005: Add encrypted SQLite persistence and migrations`) at merge commit `2161fbbf7fb4065a5913fb6e62c207546caf5dd9` from final reviewed head `325b49555dee49fa22b008d9522bbbc6eb873ca2`; final migration v0001 checksum is `e1e1f5f6d8d675a146f3d0c538a0d544b6f8a984c301d177ee1ad86e42f2d500`. Exact-head CI run #73 succeeded on Ubuntu and Windows, including Windows SQLCipher evidence for the PR-005 acceptance boundary. Migration v0001 is frozen after merge and every future schema change must use migration v0002 or later.

PR-006: COMPLETED AND HUMAN ACCEPTED. PR-007: COMPLETED AND HUMAN ACCEPTED. PR-008: AUTHORIZED, NOT STARTED; PR-009 AND LATER: UNAUTHORIZED. Gate 1: COMPLETED AND HUMAN ACCEPTED. M2: COMPLETED AND HUMAN ACCEPTED. Q-010: ACCEPTED. Q-017 remains DEFERRED. The sensitive-data/private-contour gate remains open, and real documents and personal data remain prohibited in Git, Codex and CI.

RISK-PR005-RAWKEY-PRAGMA remains accepted only for the PR-005 development boundary and remains open for installer, pilot and production release.

PR-S001/PR-S001-F1/PR-S001-F2/PR-S001-F3/PR-S001-F4 use fictional synthetic data only, may evaluate candidate packages and prototypes, must not create production database/storage APIs, and must not use real documents or personal data. PR-S001 contains no production persistence/storage API; a negative feasibility result is valid.

PR-007 is completed and human accepted. The template enforcement PR remains future work and does not close the sensitive-data/private-contour gate.

Q-009: DEFERRED. PR-006 implements no retention, deletion or secure-deletion policy.
